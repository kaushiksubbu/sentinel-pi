Status: 🟢 ACTIVE (Week 2 Milestone Reached)

🛠️ Technical Updates
AI Integration: Successfully installed Ollama (Manual ARM64 binary method) after script timeouts. Downloaded Phi-3 (2.3GB) as the core LLM.

Data Ingest: ingest_weather.py is now operational and triggered hourly via Cron.

Quality Control: Integrated DATA_QUALITY_ALERT logic to catch:

Null Values: (e.g., sensor failure).

Out-of-Range: Temperatures outside the Dutch "Sanity Zone" (-25°C to +45°C).

Logging: Switched to the logging library using absolute paths to /mnt/data/sentinel-pi/logs/cron.log.

System Health
Temperature: 39°C (Stable under download load).

Storage: Verified /mnt/data has sufficient overhead for the Phi-3 model.

API Auth: KNMI API v1 authentication verified and active.

To-Do / Next Steps
[ ] Verify first 24-hour log cycle tomorrow morning.
[ ] Test Phi-3's ability to summarize DATA_QUALITY_ALERT entries.
[ ] Review the specific KNMI API Authentication guide (Saved item) to document rate-limiting for Week 3 scaling.
