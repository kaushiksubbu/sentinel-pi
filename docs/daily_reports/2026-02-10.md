Session Goal: Shift from a monolithic script to a Modular Data Factory architecture.

Architecture Evolution: Successfully refactored ingest_weather.py into a master script that orchestrates specialized utility modules (knmi_utils, weather_utils, db_utils).

Data Quality (DQ) Integration: Defined the framework for "Silver Layer" validation (Null checks and Range checks for temp/humidity) to prevent "Garbage In" issues.

Multi-Source Strategy: Defined multisource strategy and defined to prepared the DuckDB schema to handle both "Pull" (API) and "Push" (Sensor) data streams.

Open Source Commitment: Confirmed Ollama as the local AI engine and (have to read through) Soda Core as the lightweight DQ tool to keep the stack 100% sovereign.
