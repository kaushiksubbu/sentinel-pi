# Sentinel-Pi: Sovereign Data Product Platform

> **Vision:** "Turning operational complexity into high-integrity, adaptive products. A CDMP-grounded platform focused on transforming raw telemetry into meaningful, scalable product outcomes at the edge."



## 🚀 Product Overview
Sentinel-Pi is a sovereign, local-first data platform designed to bridge the gap between raw hardware signals (IoT/Environmental telemetry) and governed product outcomes. By utilizing modern open standards, it ensures data integrity, vendor neutrality, and regulatory compliance directly on the Raspberry Pi 4.

## 🏗️ Modern Data Product Stack
This stack is selected for **high-integrity** and **hardware efficiency**, adhering to the principle of "Governance-by-Design."

| Layer | Component | Product Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Orchestration** | Dagster | Asset-based lineage & observability. |
| **Storage (OTF)** | Apache Iceberg | Transactional integrity & time-travel audits. |
| **Compute** | DuckDB | High-performance analytical processing on edge hardware. |
| **Governance** | Great Expectations | Automated Data Contracts (CDMP Standard). |

## ⚖️ Governance & Integrity (CDMP Standards)
As a Data Management professional, this project treats data as a high-value product asset:
* **Data Lifecycle Management:** Every signal is tracked from ingestion to archival.
* **Metadata Management:** Using Iceberg catalogs to maintain a single source of truth across hardware reboots.
* **Regulatory Readiness:** Architected for transparency, ensuring all automated outcomes have a verifiable audit trail.
