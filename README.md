# Sentinel-Pi: Sovereign Data Product Platform

> **Vision:** "Turning operational complexity into high-integrity, adaptive products. A CDMP-grounded platform focused on transforming raw telemetry into meaningful, scalable product outcomes at the edge."



## 🚀 Product Overview
Sentinel-Pi is a sovereign, local-first data platform designed to bridge the gap between raw hardware signals (IoT/Environmental telemetry) and governed product outcomes. By utilizing modern open standards, it ensures data integrity, vendor neutrality, and regulatory compliance directly on the Raspberry Pi 4.

## ⚖️ Governance & Integrity (CDMP Standards)
As a Data Management professional, this project treats data as a high-value product asset:
* **Data Lifecycle Management:** Every signal is tracked from ingestion to archival.
* **Metadata Management:** Using Iceberg catalogs to maintain a single source of truth across hardware reboots.
* **Regulatory Readiness:** Architected for transparency, ensuring all automated outcomes have a verifiable audit trail.


### Day 1: Identity & Infrastructure
- Initialized repository with a product-first architecture.
- Established GitHub Project Board for lifecycle management.
- Configured **Remote VS Code Tunnel** for headless Raspberry Pi management.
- Implemented **Python Virtual Environments** and **direnv** for automated environment isolation.
